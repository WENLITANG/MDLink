# Metabolite-Disease Links (MDLink)

This repo includes the data, step-by-step guidance, and analysis results for the case studies described in the MDLink manuscript:  
  **MDLink: a web server for in-depth metabolite-disease association profiling through biomedical knowledge mining.**
  
MDLink aims to facilitate the biological interpretation of understudied metabolomic biomarkers. The tool is freely available at [MDLink](http://mdlink.net.cn/).  
- (A, inputs) MDLink starts from a specific metabolite or multiple metabolites identified in various metabolic health and disease studies.  
- (B, methods) MDLink predicts the interacting proteins by three analytic branches by integrating multiple databases and methods. These predicted proteins will be matched with the disease-related gene sets (Disease Ontology, NCG, and DisGeNET) and annotated to biological function/pathway (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways).  
- (C, outputs) The visualization results of MDLink, including tables and figures, shows the connections between metabolite biomarkers, predicted proteins, related pathways.
